        <p>
            My name is Mohammad Yacoub, and I am a graduate of the University of Jordan - Mechanical Engineering
            Department. I have learnt to work with many different design programs through self-learning and continuous
            practice, and I would love to spend the rest of my life in the design field since it has become my passion
            as well as my dream, so I strive to improve all the time.

            I am a talented, ambitious and hardworking individual, with broad skills and experience in digital and
            printed marketing, social media and leading projects.

            Furthermore, I am adept at handling multiple tasks on a daily basis competently and at working well under
            pressure.

            A key strength is communication; building strong relationships with people in order to deliver the best
            results.

            Recently, I joined the coding academy by orange, to become a Full stack developer.
